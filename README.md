# CPAK Package Manager
CPAK is a package manager that is being written in golang. The goal of it is to be simple to use and develop tools for.
Before building/coding, run `chmod +x configure.sh; ./configure.sh`, to fetch all the neccesary libraries for development.
To build, run `go install github.com/member1221/cpak/cpak`, a file called cpak should now be in the bin directory.


I'm not a lawyer if any of the licensing here is wrong, please tell me (nicely) how to improve it, would be really appriciated.
